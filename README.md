# tennis-stan

This repository contains notebooks to fit tennis models with Stan. At present,
there are three different ones in ascending complexity:

* GLM (generalised linear model)
* Hierarchical GLM
* Autoregressive Hierarchical GLM

To run the notebooks, you will need the following python packages:

* seaborn
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* pystan
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* dateutil

Please post an issue if something doesn't work!
